```
docker create --rm \
           --name virtualizor \
           -p 4084:4084 \
           -p 4085:4085
           -e PUID=1000 \
           -e PGID=1000 \
           -e PASSWORD=password \
           -e EMAIL=email@gmail.com \          
           -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
           -v /opt/virtualizor:/usr/local/emps/ \
           nottt/virtualizor
```
or

```
## Parameters

* `-e PGID` for GroupID
* `-e PUID` for UserID 
* `-e PASSWORD` - Root password to access your admin panel 
* `-e EMAIL` - Email from which server will send emails 
* `-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro` - Sync time with host
* `-p *:*` - Ports used, only change the left ports.

**When editing `-v` and `-p` paremeters, the host is always the left and the container the right. Only change the left**

For shell access while the container is running do `docker exec -it virtualizor bash`.

## Setting up the application 

If you have done everything correctly you should see output similar to this with `docker logs virtualizor`

```
Congratulations, Virtualizor has been successfully installed

API KEY : key
API Password : password

You can login to the Virtualizor Admin Panel
using your ROOT details at the following URL :
https://IP:4085/
OR
http://IP:4084/
```

If you see this you can login to your admin panel, if not check your variables.


if the core server uses Google Cloud, make sure the firewall settings are on Google PVC
#### OS X and Windows

Windows and OS X platforms does not have `/etc/localtime` to retrieve timezone information, so you need to add a `-e TZ=Europe/Amsterdam` variable to your docker command and remove `-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \`.
